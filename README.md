# 3D Toxic Gas Map Display 

<p>
This program is designed to display a 3D map of a dispersed toxic gas using ReactJS, Python, and NodeJS. The program takes in data collected from air quality sensors and uses advanced visualization techniques to provide an accurate and detailed view of the gas dispersion pattern.

<li> Install the required dependencies using the package managers for ReactJS, Python, and NodeJS. </li> 
<li> Start the server using NodeJS. </li>
<li> Start the ReactJS client using npm. </li>
<li> Input the data file containing the sensor readings for the toxic gas. </li>
<li> Select the visualization settings that you prefer, such as the color scheme, gas concentration range, and 3D view angle. </li>
<li> Click the "Display" button to generate the 3D gas map. </li>

</ol>
</p>

## Usage 

<p> 
The program is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. Once you have installed the program and its dependencies, follow these steps to display the 3D gas map:

<ol>
<li> Start the NodeJS server using the command line. </li> 
<li> Start the ReactJS client using npm. </li> 
<li> Input the data file containing the sensor readings for the toxic gas. </li> 
<li> Select the visualization settings that you prefer, such as the color scheme, gas concentration range, and 3D view angle. </li> 
<li> Click the "Display" button to generate the 3D gas map. </li> 
</ol>
